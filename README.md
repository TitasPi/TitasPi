Welcome to my profile ðŸ¤—<br>
My name is Titas. A 19 years old programmer that still doesn't know which direction to go.

- ðŸ¤“ Iâ€™m currently working on working more on Github rather than private repositories in private servers.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning web frameworks like `Express, Laravel, Angular and React`.
- ðŸ§¾ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on interesting projects involving any of these languages: `C#, C++, PHP, Node.JS, Python`.
